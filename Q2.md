Question 2:
Memory allocation:
Arrays - Memory is allocated at compile time(static) and it has a contiguous block of memory
Linked lists - Memory is allocated dynaamically as nodes are added and it has anon-contiguous memory allocation

Performance:
Arrays - Fast access to elements by index is required directly 0(1)
Linked lists - Slow access to elements by index is 0(n) since transversal is needed

Insertion and deletion operations:
Arrays - Insertions and deletions are infrequent and at the end
Linked lists - Insertions and deletions are needed at the beginning or middle
